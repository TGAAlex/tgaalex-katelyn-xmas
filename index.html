    <h1>Merry Christmas, My Love! 💜</h1>
    <p>Hey baby, I know we didn't really discuss christmas presents, but I really wanted to make something for you, so I did!<br><br>Remember the 22nd, when I was talking about screen sizes.. I was talking out my ass so that I could design this specifically to your laptop screen. I couldn't exactly give the surprise away now, could I?<br><br>Anyway, I hope you have/had an amazing day, beautiful!</p>
